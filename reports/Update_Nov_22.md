## Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)
The search bar functionality is looking good. It's integrated with the genre search now. this means a user can use the search 
bar and it will only provide results from that genre. The Detail Screen has trailers at the bottom, the streaming service logos,
and the buttons to add a movie to your (or a friend's) watchlist. Some work still needs to be done on the dynamic sizing of the
screen. The profile screen is coming together nicely too. The ability to add friends is active, and when a user adds friends the 
results are displayed on the screen right away. There is just some formatting and design choices to be made on that screen.


### Agenda for Project Meeting
1. Demo of current functionality
2. Discussing next steps
3. Confirm any final edits to be made before due date (prioritize MVP functions)

### Subsection 1:
The watchlist is the biggest component left to handle. Ensuring that the user is able to see all their selections will be our
biggest task remaining. We also need to ensure that the functionality of adding to a friend's list is working properly.

### Subsection 2:
**Update (progress and issues):**
The biggest issue is the time crunch that is starting to become evident. We still have a number of things that we want to accomplish.
Ideally, we won't need to trim any of these things, but we will be working with Sahil to ensure we put the best product forward.

- **What we did:**
    - Detail screen has all components in place 
    - Search bar functional for search within a genre
    - Genre sidebar works as intended

- **Insights:**
We are beginning to see that the modularity we utilized at the beginning is paying off. It is making inserting buttons
and laying out the different pages go faster than anticipated.

### Subsection 3:

#### Back end goals for the upcoming week:
- Continue testing potential edge cases to ensure sign up and sign in are secure
- Continue to discuss hosting options once we are no longer using localhost

#### Front end goals for the upcoming week:
- 100% completion of profile pages
- 100% completion of 'add to watchlist' backend work
- 100% completion of watchlist page for user (this should be very similar in look to the homepage)

**Contributions of individual team members:**
